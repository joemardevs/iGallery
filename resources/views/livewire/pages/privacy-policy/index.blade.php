                on igallery.online. It is utilized to deliver and enhance our services, facilitate communication with you,
                and personalize your interactions with our website. Additionally, we may employ your information to send
                promotional emails or newsletters. Rest assured, you always retain the option to opt-out of receiving such
                communications, placing control firmly in your hands. We value your preferences and respect your choices.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Sharing Your Information</h3>
            <p class="ml-4 text-justify">Rest assured, your personal information is not for sale, trade, or rent to third
                parties by igallery.online. While we prioritize your privacy, there are instances where we may share your
                information with trusted third-party service providers. These providers assist us in website operations,
                business processes, or serving you better. Importantly, these third parties are bound by confidentiality
                obligations and are only authorized to utilize your information for the purposes expressly specified by us.

                igallery.online. We employ a range of measures to safeguard it from unauthorized access, disclosure,
                alteration, or destruction. It is important to note, however, that while we implement rigorous security
                protocols, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely infallible.
                Consequently, we cannot provide an absolute guarantee of security. Your understanding of this inherent
                limitation is appreciated as we continuously strive to enhance and fortify our security measures.
